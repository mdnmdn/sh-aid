# sh-aid Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of the sh-aid shell AI assistant tool in Rust, ported from the TypeScript version.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2)
- [x] Project initialization with Cargo
- [ ] Dependency configuration
- [ ] Basic project structure setup
- [ ] Development environment validation

**Key Deliverables:**
- Configured Cargo.toml with all required dependencies
- Basic module structure in place
- Compilation working without errors

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Days 3-5)
- [ ] Configuration management system
- [ ] System context gathering utilities
- [ ] Error handling framework
- [ ] Basic CLI argument parsing

**Key Deliverables:**
- Config file reading/writing with JSON support
- System information collection (OS, resources, directory listing)
- Robust error types and handling
- Command-line interface foundation

### Phase 3: AI Provider Integration with Rig (Days 6-9)
- [ ] Rig framework integration setup
- [ ] OpenAI provider implementation using Rig
- [ ] Claude provider implementation using Rig
- [ ] Gemini provider implementation using Rig
- [ ] Provider selection and configuration logic
- [ ] Rig-based error handling and retry mechanisms

**Key Deliverables:**
- Rig framework integration with simplified LLM connectivity
- Provider implementations using Rig's abstractions
- Unified error handling leveraging Rig's built-in mechanisms
- Configuration mapping between sh-aid config and Rig providers
- Performance benefits from Rig's optimized implementations

### Phase 4: Command Generation (Days 10-12)
- [ ] Prompt engineering and system context integration
- [ ] Response parsing and validation
- [ ] Command sanitization and safety checks
- [ ] Output formatting

**Key Deliverables:**
- Natural language to command conversion
- Context-aware prompt generation
- Clean command output without extra formatting
- Input validation and security measures

### Phase 5: Testing & Quality (Days 13-15)
- [ ] Unit tests for all modules
- [ ] Integration tests for full workflows
- [ ] Mock API testing
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

**Key Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive test suite with >80% coverage
- Mock providers for testing without API calls
- Verified functionality on Linux, macOS, Windows
- Performance metrics and optimization recommendations

### Phase 6: Documentation & Release (Days 16-18)
- [ ] Code documentation and examples
- [ ] User guide and README updates
- [ ] Installation instructions
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Release preparation

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete API documentation
- User-friendly installation and usage guide
- Error message catalog and solutions
- Ready for initial release

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Maintain feature parity with TypeScript version
- ✅ Support all three AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- ✅ Cross-platform configuration management
- ✅ Context-aware command generation
- ✅ Clean, executable command output

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ Sub-second response time for most commands
- ✅ Graceful error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Secure API key storage and handling
- ✅ Memory-efficient operation
- ✅ Single binary distribution

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **API Rate Limits**: Implement retry logic and rate limiting
2. **Configuration Compatibility**: Ensure backward compatibility with existing configs
3. **Cross-Platform Issues**: Test thoroughly on all target platforms
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Audit for command injection and API key exposure

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Performance Regression**: Benchmark against TypeScript version
2. **Error Handling Gaps**: Comprehensive error scenario testing
3. **Dependency Conflicts**: Pin dependency versions and test compatibility

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation
2. Set up continuous integration pipeline
3. Create development branches for major features
4. Establish code review process
